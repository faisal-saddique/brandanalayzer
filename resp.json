            "text": "Tried Clickfunnels 2.0 for my business and although it looks promising it just has too many flaws for businesses to take it seriously.\n\n1) Faulty Facebook tracking - this is probably the biggest one. Instead of tracking successful purchases like every other platform, it tracks all purchases (even unsuccessful attempts like declined transactions, failed CVV etc).  This means you cannot use Facebook ads as you cannot track your purchases correctly.\n\n2) No Apple Pay. We've used Apple Pay in the past and it has increased our conversions by over 50%. Clickfunnels does not have the option for Apple Pay, Google Pay, Klarna etc. \nIt is 2024, this is absolutely unacceptable.\n\n3) Glitchy Platform. Every once in a while the platform freezes for no reason and you have to refresh the page losing your work.  \n\nIn conclusion, while clickfunnels looked promising at the start, it is lacking in so many major ways that the clickfunnels 2.0 feels like a downgrade in so many ways. \n\nThere are just so many better platforms out there that I would not recommend clickfunnels to anyone looking for funnel/website builder for their business.",

If I could, I'd give this course way more than 5 stars!\n\nAs for the Clickfunnels software, there was a bit of a learning curve, but it's been so worth it. My sales funnels and website have gone from 'meh' to 'wow'! They look super professional now, way clearer, and the layout is just so much cleaner.

The issue is if you are not actively utilizing the software then the cost outweighs the benefit.\n\nI give this company 1 star because if you decide to end your membership they \"delete all your work permanently\" without any way of backing it up. That to me was a waste of over $1750 in freelancer work plus 3 months of paying upwards of $199 for a funnel I did not get to utilize. I think the money-grab tactic of this company is far too painful and they need to bring back a way to go inactive either for free or a small $10 monthly fee like they used to have.",
